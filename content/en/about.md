**Hi, I'm Islam Tohamy!**
I work as a Senior Security Engineer üë®‚Äçüíª in ICS/OT environments. Day-to-day, I work with tools like Metasploit, Nmap, Tenable, Impacket, BloodHound, Burp Suite, and Wireshark as part of doing network assessments and Active Directory testing. For OT network security, I work with tools like Claroty, Armis, and Microsoft Defender for IoT to manage assets, identify and remediate vulnerabilities, and monitor security.

I actually started out as an electrical engineer, building and programming low voltage controls e.g., IoT devices, smart wearables,then I moved to industrial controls (high voltage) programming PLCs, HMIs, VFDs, SCADA, and designing supervisory control cabinets (SCC), motor control cabinets (MCC) ..etc ‚Äî basically everything you‚Äôd expect in OT environments. That hands-on experience with the tech itself is what got me into OT security, where I found that I like to work on protecting these essential/industrial systems.

Outside of work, I‚Äôm always down for a CTF with friends, practicing on THM or HTB machines, catching up on security talks for learning, or ricing up *nix systems just for fun.
