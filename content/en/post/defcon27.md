**DEFCON 27** – this was my first time at DEFCON! I've been to a few security cons before, like **HOPE (Hackers on Planet Earth)** in NYC and **Bayside** multiple times, but DEFCON was a whole new experience. I had no idea what to expect when I got there!

I knew DEFCON followed **Black Hat** and had a reputation for being way more laid-back. Unlike Black Hat, DEFCON doesn’t have as much corporate advertising. That’s something my friends who had been to both told me about, and it sounded cool. I was at Defcon from **Thursday to Sunday** and was all set for an adventure.

I’d heard about the "hacking horrors" that go down there. DEFCON is famous for bringing together hackers, journalists, tech and non-tech people who go for the talks, the connections, and of course, the experience. I came prepared with a **burner laptop** just for the **CTF (Capture The Flag)** challenges. My friends also warned me about the rogue cell towers, so I kept my phone on **airplane mode**.

A few friends suggested skipping the CTFs because they said the "real DEFCON experience" is all about exploring, meeting people, and checking out the **lab tracks**. Plus, participating in labs gets you some cool **SWAG** – mostly LED badges to wear around the con!

## Checking Out the Villages

I spent a lot of my time hanging out in the **villages**. DEFCON has tons of them, like **Hardware**, **Soldering**, **IoT**, **Industrial Control Systems**, **Biohacking**, **Packet Hacking**, **Crypto**, **Wireless**, **Rootz (for kids)**, **Lock Picking**, **AppSec**, **Social Engineering**, **AI**, **Red Team**, **Blue Team**, and the new **Aviation Village** (which I heard was introduced at DEFCON 27 for the first time). With all the lab tracks, workshops, talks, and **SkyTalks**, it was pretty much impossible to do it all, so I had to pick the talks I was interested in.

### Hardware Village

The **Hardware Village** was one of my favorites. They had a ton of **PLC (Programmable Logic Controller)** and **industrial control** setups where people were testing hacking them. A lot of the setups were running on a**Raspberry Pi** with emulated industrial systems using **OpenPLC** and **HMI SCADA software**. Some tables even had **CTFs** where you could try breaking into their emulated control systems – pretty cool!

### Car Hacking Village

The **Car Hacking Village** was awesome! There was a Dodge charger with lots of wires sticking out of it, and some hackers were controlling the blinkers, windshield wipers, and starting the engine remotely. That was pure DEFCON fun! And there’s always at least one person practicing lock picking on car doors lol. I haven’t tried lock picking yet, but it’s definitely something I want to learn.

### Soldering Village

The **Soldering Village** was really chill. People were soldering badges they collected, adding LEDs and other components. If you didn’t have a board, you could go to the main table and ask, and they’d give you one to work on. Each hardware-type village seemed to have one **guru** – someone who’s been doing this forever and was helping others out. It gave DEFCON this awesome community vibe.

### Aviation Village

The **Aviation Village** was in the same area as the hardware, soldering, and car villages, so I popped in there too. They had virtual reality stations where you could fly an aircraft with a VR headset. The big attraction was the **Lockheed Martin F-35 cockpit simulator** – an exact replica of the F-35 cockpit! Tons of buttons in front of you, and three huge screens showing a bird’s-eye view as you "flew" over different cities. A Lockheed person stood by to help out, which was good because the controls were intense!

## Red Team and IoT Villages

After that, I swung by the **Red Team Village** and **IoT Village**. There were some solid talks and another CTF happening. I then checked out the **Packet Village** with its infamous **Wall of Sheep**, showing attendees’ insecure network traffic and Bluetooth connections that had been sniffed. Luckily, I didn’t see my name up there – haha!

## Final Thoughts

Overall DEFCON 27 was a great experience, and I met some amazing people. I’m definitely looking forward to going again!
