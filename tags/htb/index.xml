      <description>Box IP: 10.10.10.152 Reconnaissance 1) I started with scanning network. Here&amp;rsquo;s what I found
2) Port 80, we have a login page or PRTG Network Monitor. I found it was vulnerable for cross site Vulnerability
3) filezilla, I messed around with ftp 21..looking for the configuration.old file that contained the creds according to this post on reddit https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/862b8s/prtg_gave_away_some_of_your_passwords/ .. But I couldnt find it.. later on I was hinted that It was a hiddden file.</description>

      <description>Box IP: 10.10.10.98 Reconnaissance 1) I started with scanning network. Here&amp;rsquo;s what I found
PORT STATE SERVICE VERSION
   21/tcp open ftp Microsoft ftpd     23/tcp open telnet?   80/tcp open http Microsoft IIS httpd 7.5    2) Port 80, we have a picture of a server room, &amp;ldquo;out.jpg&amp;rdquo; .. saved that for later
I ran the out.jpg in stegsolve, maybe there was a hidden htb flag inside, but there was nothing and even with strings and binwalk they showed nothing interesting so I moved on to the ftp service.</description>
